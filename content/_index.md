Welcome to The WebDev Blog, I'm very glad you are here!

This website was made with the objective of teaching you (and in the process learn myself), what I believe are the fundamentals technologies to become a **Full-Stack Web Developer**.

I'm going to write learning materials in the form of tutorials, quizzes and projects (both as code-alongs and homeworks) for anyone who wants to learn along with me.

For starters, some of the topics that we're going to cover are:

1. <span class="underline">Tools of the Trade:</span> The command line, text editors, the browser, etc...
2. <span class="underline">HTML:</span> To Structure our web pages.
3. <span class="underline">CSS:</span> To Style our web pages.
4. <span class="underline">JavaScript:</span> To add Interactivity to our web pages.

Have in mind that I'm not an expert ninja programmer and that I don't even work as web developer (yet). I'm just a beginner that wants to share the things I've learned in the past or that I'm currently learning.

If you feel attracted to the idea of following along the path of someone who wants to become a great programmer and help others along the way, keep reading through the pages ;).
