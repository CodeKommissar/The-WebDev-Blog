This page is going to act as a sort of Frequently Asked Questions. I expect the numbers of questions to grow as I get more feedback from you, the reader.

#### 1. How does the Blog work?

Easy, read every page and follow along with the tutorials, answer the quizzes and do the projects.

My email direction is in the next page, so feel free to contact me if:

1. You feel that something isn't explained well enough or that I left something out.
2. You'd like some feedback on a project that you've finished.
3. You need some specific advice regarding your situation.
4. You'd like to see a specific topic or technology covered here.
5. You have some guidance or recommendations you'll like to give me.

#### 2. Why Full-Stack Web Development?

Because being Full-Stack Developer means that you can do everything when it comes to making a Web Application. Dealing with server-side programming languages, databases, and making everything look nice on the front-end is just what you do as a Full-Stack Developer.

Whether you end up focusing in a more specific area of expertise as a Front-End Developer, a Back-End Engineer or even maybe as a Technical Entrepreneur, I think it is really valuable to have a complete view of the terrain when you are working to create software with a team.

#### 3. How can I become a Web Developer and work as one?

One of the biggest reasons I like the tech industry is the "pragmatism" that surrounds it. One of the consequences of this pragmatism is that your educational background doesn't matter as much as in other professions.

Due to the fact that the wealth of information we have online as programmers is more abundant than for many other skills or disciplines (Imagine training yourself to be a doctor online, or learning a PhD level of theoretical physics just by doing tutorials), it is relative easier to teach yourself programming if you just happen to be passionate about it.

According to the 2016 survey from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (Think of StackOverflow as the programmer version of Quora or Yahoo Answers), almost 70% of developers are self-taught, and less than the half of developers surveyed, have a technology-related undergraduate or graduate degree. So if you really like programming and think you'd like to work as one, I would say that you should just go for it, there haven't been a better moment in history to try it.
