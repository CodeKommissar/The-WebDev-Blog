You still remember how to use [The Command Line](/the_command_line), right?

If you're new to this blog and don't know how to use the terminal,
or if you already forgot the basic commands, give that section a quick
review and come back.

Why? Because you'll be doing your first assignment right now:

1. Open your terminal, you should be in your *home* directory.
2. U  sing the **cd** command, go inside your "The_WebDev_Blog" directory.
3. Inside of the "The_WebDev_Blog" directory, using the **mkdir** command,
create a new directory called "HTML".
4. Go inside that "HTML" directory and making use of the **touch** command
create a new file inside of it called "index.html".
5. You're going to use a new command right now, so pay attention. if you installed [Atom](https://atom.io) like I told you to do in the last page, enter this
command in your terminal: <br/> `$ atom .` <br/> the "**atom .**"
command will start Atom in your computer with your current directory as the
"target" of the editor.

{{% notice warning %}}
It is really important that the file you created in step 4
(index.html) **does** ends with ".html". If it doesn't, the browser
won't interpret the file correctly.
{{% /notice %}}

Don't close your terminal because we'll be using it later ;).

In Atom, at the left side of your screen, there should be the "HTML" directory
graphically represented and the "index.html" nested inside of it, double click
the "index.html" file.

Your screen should look similar to this:

You can click on the image to see it in a better resolution.
{{% /notice %}}

Now we're truly ready to start writing HTML!
