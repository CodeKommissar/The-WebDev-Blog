### Block-Level Elements

The elements we learned about in the last page (`<h1>` and `<p>`) are
**block-level** elements, what do I mean with this? Block-level elements
are elements that use all the available width in the place at which they're
displayed in the browser, and have a top and bottom spacing (called margin).

It is going to be easier if we visualize this. Luckily our browsers give us
a set of tools to make our lives as developers easier.

Whether you're on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, press Ctrl + Shift + C.
This set of keys should open your developer tools.

Using your mouse, hover over your HTML page. It should look something like this:

Here, I'm hovering over the `<h1>` element. In the blue background we can see
represented the width of the element and in the
orange/salmon shade we see the top and bottom spacing (margin) of the element.

Notice at the bottom of the screen how the browser gives us an
interactive representation of the code that we can play around with.
