All right, to start learning HTML, first we need to install a couple of
programs into our computer; a **Web Browser**
and a **Text Editor**.

### Web Browser

If you are reading this, I'm 99% sure that you are using a
web browser right now. For this tutorial a modern version of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) should be more than fine to
develop our web pages.

If you already have one of those browsers installed on your computer, keep reading.
Else, go and download one of them, I'll wait for you here ;).

### Text Editor

To write our code, we'll need a text editor. Basically, a text editor is a program that let us write, edit, and save text files. Although you may be thinking that you could use something like Microsoft Word to write code, the simple truth is that you shouldn't do that (Long-story short: office document editors like MS Word rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers).

In this tutorial I'll be using [Atom](https://atom.io) which is a specialized text editor for programming created by the folks at [Github](https://github.com). Atom comes with some features that will make our lives easier (like syntax highlighting) while writting our HTML.

Go to the Atom link above, download the correct version for your operating system and install it. Then you'll be ready for the next page.
