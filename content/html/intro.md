HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it is a language that computers
can understand, but it isn't a Programming Language in itself, as its name tell us,
it is a Markup Language.

### High Level Overview

HTML is made with 'tags' which allow us to describe the contents of our website,
just to name a couple, we have <h1> tags for our Headings and <p> tags
for paragraphs.

Tags (usually come in pairs); an opening tag and closing tag. For example,
to describe the days of the week as a single paragraph in HTML, we would go like
this:

<p>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday</p>

Notice the two tags: <p> and </p>, the first tag (opening) doesn't have a slash
and the last tag (closing) does have a slash.

The way in which we use these tags is that we enclose our content with them,
for example if I want to describe the first page of the Moby Dick novel,
I would do it like this:

### A Little Bit of History

HTML was created by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)
between 1989 and 1990 with the purpose of:

1) Having a simple standard format to publish scientific and technical documents.

2) Allowing these documents to be easily shareable with the help of the
Internet.

That's basically all that there is to HTML. A simple standard to write to documents
that anyone could read and link through the Internet.

This first version of HTML was all about text and links. As time went through,
with Internet speeds going up and being more accessible to the regular people like
you and me, new versions of HTML emerged to add new features to the language
like; New Tags, Images, Sound, Video and even GeoLocation.

The current version of HTML is HTML5, which is what we are going to be learning
on this section and it includes all of the features we see above and more.

### Why is HTML important?

HTML represents the basic structure of almost all of the Internet. To make
a simple analogy, think of HTML as the bone structure in your body, without
your bones holding your body, you would be just laying on the ground all day
without being able to do much.

As Front-End/Full-Stack developers we're going to see a lot of HTML (at least
at the beginning of our Journey) and to be honest, you could learn almost 90%
of the HTML you need to know in a couple of days. It is going to be simple,
fun and good for your career, so why don't you keep going and go to the next page?
