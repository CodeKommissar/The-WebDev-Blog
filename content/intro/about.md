Before we begin this journey, let me introduce myself.

![A photo of myself](me.jpg?width=60%)

My name is Luis and I'm from Venezuela. Currently I'm 20 years old and I'm studying Electronics Engineering here in Venezuela.

My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer and to work as one. If you have heard how things currently are in Venezuela, you may know that the situation here isn't so great, so if I have the opportunity to go to a more stable country and make a living working as a developer while helping to support my family, I'd be more than happy to do so.

I really want to be a Web Developer because it is something that I can see myself doing everyday, it is an activity that combines logical thinking with creative thinking, and I really like that. I just love the fact that I'm always creating new things and solving problems.

My hobbies include:

* Reading Books
* Listening to Music (I love alternative and indie music)
* Playing and Watching Soccer (Go [Arsenal!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/))
* Working out (Mostly bodyweight exercises)
* Videogames (My favorites are Shadow of the Colossus, The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, and Persona 4)
* Writing (As in this blog :))
* and Programming

Feel free to send me a mail (my email address is at the [Collaborating](../../extras/collaborating) page) if you'd like to talk about some of the topics above or to discuss things/ask some questions related to the blog. I'll try to reply your mail as soon as possible :)
