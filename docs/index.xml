      <description>HTML stands for: Hyper Text Markup Language and its job is to describe the structure and content of web pages. HTML is composed of elements that describe what do we want to display in the browser.
A Little Bit of History HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee between 1989 and 1990 with the purposes of:
 Having a simple standard format to publish scientific and technical documents.
 Allowing these documents to be easily shareable with the help of the Internet.</description>

      <description>All of the contents on this blog are 100% free, but to begin, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need a couple of things if you want to follow along and become a good programmer in general:
1) Desktop Computer or Laptop with Linux/MacOS &amp;ldquo;Desktop Computer or Laptop&amp;rdquo; is pretty basic. A regular computer or old laptop should be more than fine to learn web development.
Sadly you can&amp;rsquo;t, or at least you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t program in a phone or tablet.</description>

      <link>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/introduction/</link>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/introduction/</guid>
      <description>The first thing we are going to learn are the fundamentals of the command line. Specifically, we will cover the basics of the Unix command line, where Unix refers to the family of operating systems that includes Linux and Mac OS, but you&amp;rsquo;ll still be able to follow along if you use Windows.
To start, you don&amp;rsquo;t need any previous knowledge. I&amp;rsquo;ll assume that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know what the command line is or why do we use it.</description>

      <description>All right, to start learning HTML, first we need to install a couple of programs into our computer; a Web Browser and a Text Editor.
Web Browser If you are reading this, I&amp;rsquo;m 99% sure that you are using a web browser right now. For this tutorial, a modern version of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome should be more than fine to develop our web pages.
If you already have one of those browsers installed on your computer, keep reading.</description>

      <description>To make your experience learning the command line a little bit more fun, use your imagination and picture that you are playing a text adventure like this:
The first step to start playing the game, is well, to open the game:
1) Entering the Command Line On Ubuntu  Open the Dash by clicking the Ubuntu icon in the upper-left. Type &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; in the search box. Select the Terminal application from the results that appear and click it.</description>

      <description>Here are some pointers that I would like to have received when I started this journey.
1) Download an app to track how many hours a day you are coding (And use it) I have a Windows Phone, so I downloaded an app called Pomodoro T-Soft, which I use everyday. If you have an iOS device Pomodoro Keeper is the app from the screenshots above, and for Android users I think that a good option is ClearFocus.</description>

      <description>You still remember how to use The Command Line, right?
If you&amp;rsquo;re new to this blog and don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use the terminal, or if you already forgot the basic commands, give that section a quick review and come back.
Why? Because you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing your first assignment right now:
 Open your terminal, you should be in your home directory. Using the cd command, go inside your &amp;ldquo;The_WebDev_Blog&amp;rdquo; directory.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/shortcuts/</link>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/shortcuts/</guid>
      <description>Now that you know some basic commands, we are going to learn some shortcuts.
I hope that learning these shortcuts serve us two purposes; first, after you learn them, shortcuts are going to save you some precious time while using the command line, and second, if you still don&amp;rsquo;t feel 100% comfortable while using the terminal, learning these shortcuts can help you overcome some of that command line resistance.</description>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/intro/about/</guid>
      <description>Before we begin this journey, let me introduce myself.
My name is Luis and I&amp;rsquo;m from Venezuela. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m 20 years old and I&amp;rsquo;m studying Electronics Engineering here in Venezuela.
My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer and to work as one. If you have heard how things currently are in Venezuela, you may know that the situation here isn&amp;rsquo;t so great, so if I have the opportunity to go to a more stable country and make a living working as a developer while helping to support my family, I&amp;rsquo;d be more than happy to do so.</description>

      <description>Now that we have everything we need to write HTML, we&amp;rsquo;ll begin by covering the basic structure of every (good) HTML document.
DOCTYPE! The first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to add to our HTML document is the DOCTYPE or &amp;ldquo;Document Type Declaration&amp;rdquo;. In the first line of your &amp;ldquo;index.html&amp;rdquo; file, type this:
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;  This &amp;ldquo;Document Type Declaration&amp;rdquo; tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in.</description>

      <title>Playing with scrolls</title>
      <link>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/playing_with_scrolls/</link>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/the_command_line/playing_with_scrolls/</guid>
      <description>Now that you know how to run basic commands at the terminal, along with a few shortcuts, we are going to start working with files. Because we are wizards, we are going to be playing with &amp;ldquo;scrolls&amp;rdquo; instead of just simple text files. Inside these scrolls, we are going to write the recipes of our potions.
Imagine this; you are in your Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Lair, fiddling around with alchemy ingredients (in this case, all you had left was Luna Moth Wings with Chaurus Eggs), and out of pure luck you made an Invisibility potion.</description>

      <title>Adding Text</title>
      <link>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/html/text/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2017 22:17:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/html/text/</guid>
      <description>Your HTML document should be looking similar to this:
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Awesome Title&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; Hello World! &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;  We&amp;rsquo;ve already added text, but that text is not semantic enough. As far as the browser knows, this text are just random words floating in the body of our page.
When I say it &amp;ldquo;is not semantic enough&amp;rdquo; what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a real meaning.</description>

      <title>Inline vs Blocks</title>
      <link>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/html/inline_blocks/</link>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/html/inline_blocks/</guid>
      <description>Block-Level Elements The elements we learned about in the last page (&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;) are block-level elements. What do I mean with this? Block-level elements are elements that use all the available width in the place at which they&amp;rsquo;re displayed in the browser, and have a top and bottom spacing (called margin) surrounding them.
It is going to be easier if we visualize this. Luckily our browsers give us a set of tools to make development better.</description>

      <guid>https://codekommissar.github.io/The-WebDev-Blog/html/images/</guid>
      <description>To add images to our document we use the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; element. The basic pattern to use this element for adding images to our webpage is this:
&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;image.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;A brief description of the image&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  As we can see, the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; element is comprised of a single tag and a couple of attributes. Remember that the mission of attributes is to provide additional information to their element.
In this case, the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; needs a src (short for &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo;) attribute that tells the element where the image is located at, and it should have an alt (short for &amp;ldquo;alternative text&amp;rdquo;) attribute which has a couple of functions to it:</description>
